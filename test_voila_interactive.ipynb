    "# Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process: An Interactive Computational Essay\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mathematical Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process is a mean-reverting stochastic process widely used in quantitative finance to model interest rates, volatility, and other financial variables that exhibit mean reversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process is defined by the stochastic differential equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$dX_t = \\theta(\\mu - X_t)dt + \\sigma dW_t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $X_t$ is the value of the process at time $t$\n",
    "- $\\theta > 0$ is the **mean reversion rate** (speed of reversion to the mean)\n",
    "- $\\mu$ is the **long-term mean** (equilibrium level)\n",
    "- $\\sigma > 0$ is the **volatility** (magnitude of random fluctuations)\n",
    "- $W_t$ is a Wiener process (standard Brownian motion)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mean Reversion**: When $X_t > \\mu$, the drift term $\\theta(\\mu - X_t)$ becomes negative, pulling the process downward. Conversely, when $X_t < \\mu$, the drift is positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Stationary Distribution**: The OU process has a stationary normal distribution with mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\frac{\\sigma^2}{2\\theta}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Autocorrelation**: The process exhibits exponentially decaying autocorrelation with correlation coefficient $\\rho(\\tau) = e^{-\\theta \\tau}$.\n",

    "### Effect of Mean Reversion Rate (θ)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Higher θ**: Faster reversion to the mean. The process quickly returns to μ after deviations.\n",
    "- **Lower θ**: Slower reversion, allowing the process to wander further from the mean.\n",

    "Try adjusting θ from 0.1 to 2.0 and observe how quickly the process returns to the mean level.\n",

    "\n",
    "- The mean acts as an attractor—the process gravitates toward this level over time.\n",
    "- Changing μ shifts the entire distribution without affecting the reversion speed or volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Effect of Volatility (σ)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Higher σ**: Larger random fluctuations around the mean. The confidence bands widen.\n",
    "- **Lower σ**: Smoother trajectories with tighter clustering around the mean.\n",

    "2. **Volatility** (in stochastic volatility models): Volatility exhibits mean-reverting behavior\n",
    "3. **Pairs trading**: The spread between cointegrated assets can be modeled as mean-reverting\n",
